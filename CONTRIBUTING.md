# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an **issue**. This can be a feature request or a bug report. After a maintainer has triaged your issue, you are welcome to collaborate on a pull request. If your change is small or uncomplicated, you are welcome to open an issue and pull request simultaneously.

Please note we have a **code of conduct**, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Setting up for local development

1. Fork this repostiory.
2. Clone your fork.
3. Create a new branch in your local repository with the following pattern:

- For bug fixes: `bug/[package_name]/[issue_number]/[descriptive_bug_name]`
- For features: `feature/[package_name]/[issue_number]/[descriptive_feature_name]`
- For chores/the rest: `chore/[package_name]/[descriptive_chore_name]`

4. Install & hoist dependencies with Yarn + Lerna: `yarn install`
5. Add `./node_modules/.bin` to your system's [`PATH`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)), if it's not already listed.
6. Start building for development: `yarn build`

> Note: There is no hot-reloading development script for now (which sucks, I know). Recently, the build system in Magic JS SDK changed to use a bundler as opposed to delivering TSC-transpiled files. This has complicated the matter of serving a development-specific flow. We will revisit this problem in the future.

### ESLint + VS Code (Optional)

To ensure ESLint is able to properly lint source files in your VS Code development environment, add the following configuration to your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "eslint.workingDirectories": [
    { "directory" : "./packages/@magic-ext/oauth", "changeProcessCWD": true },
    { "directory" : "./packages/@magic-ext/...", "changeProcessCWD": true },
    { "directory" : "./packages/@magic-sdk/commons", "changeProcessCWD": true },
    { "directory" : "./packages/@magic-sdk/provider", "changeProcessCWD": true },
    { "directory" : "./packages/@magic-sdk/...", "changeProcessCWD": true },
    { "directory" : "./packages/magic-sdk", "changeProcessCWD": true },
  ],
}
```

### Development scripts

> Note: all development scripts are designed to be executed from the **repository root!**

| NPM Script | Usage | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `wsrun` | `PKG=$PACKAGE_TARGET yarn wsrun` | Execute arbitrary scripts via `wsrun` for the specified package, or interactively select a package if `$PKG` is omitted. |
| `wsrun:all` | `yarn wsrun` | Execute arbitrary scripts via `wsrun` for the all packages in the monorepo (same as `PKG=* yarn wsrun ...`). |
| `dev` | `PKG=$PACKAGE_TARGET yarn dev` | Build the specified package with a hot-reloading dev server, or interactively select a package if `$PKG` is omitted. |
| `build` | `PKG=$PACKAGE_TARGET yarn build` | Build the specified package for production, or interactively select a package if `$PKG` is omitted. |
| `clean` | `PKG=$PACKAGE_TARGET yarn clean` | Run cleaning scripts for the specified package,or interactively select a package if `$PKG` is omitted. Available flags: (`--cache`, `--test-artifacts`, `--deps`) |
| `lint` | `PKG=$PACKAGE_TARGET yarn lint` | Run the linter for the specified package, or interactively select a package if `$PKG` is omitted. |
| `test` | `PKG=$PACKAGE_TARGET yarn test` | Run tests for the specified package, or interactively select a package if `$PKG` is omitted. |

## Opening a Pull Request

1. Open a pull request from your fork/branch to the upstream `master` branch of _this_ repository.
2. Add a label for the [semver](https://semver.org/) update corresponding to your changes: `patch`, `minor`, or `major`.
3. A maintainer will review your code changes and offer feedback or suggestions if necessary. Once your changes are approved, a maintainer will merge the pull request for you and publish a release.

## Cutting a release

We use [`auto`](https://github.com/intuit/auto) as our continous delivery tool. Cutting a release is just a matter of merging to `master`. For pre-releases, you can create a `next` branch as the base for your experimental/W.I.P. feature. Please familiarize yourself with the [documentation for `auto`](https://intuit.github.io/auto/docs) if you are in a position to cut a release.

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [support@magic.link](mailto:support@magic.link).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the

the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
