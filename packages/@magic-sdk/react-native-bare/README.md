## ⚠️ Removal of `loginWithMagicLink()`  ⚠️
As of `v19.0.0`, passcodes (ie. `loginWithSMS()`, `loginWithEmailOTP()`) are replacing Magic Links (ie. `loginWithMagicLink()`) for all of our Mobile SDKs⁠. [Learn more](https://magic.link/docs/auth/login-methods/email/email-link-update-march-2023)

## 📖 Documentation

See the [developer documentation](https://magic.link/docs) to learn how you can master the Magic SDK in a matter of minutes.

## 🔗 Installation

Integrating your app with Magic will require our client-side NPM package: 

```bash
# Via NPM:
npm install --save @magic-sdk/react-native-bare
npm install --save react-native-device-info # Required Peer Dependency
npm install --save @react-native-community/async-storage # Required Peer Dependency
npm install --save react-native-safe-area-context # Required Peer Dependency

# Via Yarn:
yarn add @magic-sdk/react-native-bare
⁠yarn add react-native-device-info # Required Peer Dependency
yarn add @react-native-community/async-storage # Required Peer Dependency
yarn add react-native-safe-area-context # Required Peer Dependency
```

## ⚡️ Quick Start

Sign up or log in to the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.magic.link ) to receive API keys that will allow your application to interact with Magic's authentication APIs. 

Then, you can start authenticating users with _just one method!_

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Magic } from '@magic-sdk/react-native-bare';
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

const magic = new Magic('YOUR_API_KEY');

export default function App() {
  return <>
	 <SafeAreaProvider>
	    {/* Render the Magic iframe! */}
	    <magic.Relayer />
	    {...}
	 </SafeAreaProvider>
  </>
}

// Somewhere else in your code...
await magic.auth.loginWithEmailOTP({ email: 'your.email@example.com' });
```

## 👀 SafeAreaView
Please note that as of **v14.0.0** our React Native package offerings wrap the `<magic.Relayer />` in [react-native-safe-area-context's](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context) `<SafeAreaView />`. To prevent any adverse behavior in your app, please place the Magic iFrame React component at the root view of your application wrapped in a [SafeAreaProvider](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context#safeareaprovider) as described in the documentation. 

We have also added an optional `backgroundColor` prop to the `Relayer` to fix issues with `SafeAreaView` showing the background. By default, the background will be white. If you have changed the background color as part of your [custom branding setup](https://magic.link/docs/authentication/features/login-ui#configuration), make sure to pass your custom background color to `magic.Relayer`:
```tsx
<magic.Relayer backgroundColor="#0000FF"/>
```
