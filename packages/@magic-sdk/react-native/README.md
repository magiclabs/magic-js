## Package Split!! 

Since `v9.0.0`, `@magic-sdk/react-native` package drops support of bare React Native (RN). You may stay on `^v8.0.0` to keep your bare RN app functional. With this in mind, bare React Native applications utlilizing OAuth should note that `@magic-ext/react-native-oauth` uses `expo-web-browser` as a dependency.

If this dependency causes you issues, consider enabling the expo library via `npx install-expo-modules@latest`. For more context, you may check: https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules.

Another work around currently [under review](https://github.com/magiclabs/magic-js/pull/366) is replacing `expo-web-browser` with  [react native in-app browser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-inappbrowser-reborn). We plan to release a new package to support bare-RN exclusively soon.

This package will mainly support **Expo** framework in future releases.

## üìñ Documentation

See the [developer documentation](https://magic.link/docs) to learn how you can master the Magic SDK in a matter of minutes.

## üîó Installation

Integrating your app with Magic will require our client-side NPM package:

```bash
# Via NPM:
npm install --save @magic-sdk/react-native

# Via Yarn:
yarn add @magic-sdk/react-native
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

Sign up or log in to the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.magic.link) to receive API keys that will allow your application to interact with Magic's authentication APIs.

Then, you can start authenticating users with _just one method!_

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Magic } from '@magic-sdk/react-native';

const magic = new Magic('YOUR_API_KEY');

export default function App() {
  return <>
    {/* Render the Magic iframe! */}
    <magic.Relayer />
    {...}
  </>
}

// Somewhere else in your code...
await magic.auth.loginWithMagicLink({ email: 'your.email@example.com' });
```
