## ⚠️ Package Split 

Since `v9.0.0`, `@magic-sdk/react-native` package drops support of bare React Native (RN). You may stay on `^v8.0.0` to keep your bare RN app functional. All bare React Native applications utlilizing OAuth should note that `@magic-ext/react-native-oauth` grandfathered in `expo-web-browser` as a dependency. As a work around you will may have to remove this dependency.

In the future, we will release a new package to support bare-RN exclusively.
